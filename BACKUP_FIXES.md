# MegaBackup Space Error Fixes

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Overly Restrictive Space Checking
**Problem**: The backup system was blocking backups when available space was less than or equal to WordPress site size, even on unlimited space hosting.

**Solution**: 
- Modified space checking logic to handle unlimited space scenarios
- Added detection for hosting providers with unlimited space (50TB+ threshold)
- Only show warnings when space is less than 50% of site size (instead of 100%)

### 2. Unreliable Disk Space Detection
**Problem**: `disk_free_space()` function returns unreliable values on some hosting providers.

**Solution**:
- Added fallback mechanism for unlimited space detection
- Set space to PHP_INT_MAX when unlimited space is detected
- Updated UI to show "Unlimited" instead of confusing large numbers

### 3. Poor Error Handling During ZIP Creation
**Problem**: ZIP creation failures didn't provide helpful error messages.

**Solution**:
- Added comprehensive ZIP error code mapping
- Improved error messages for space-related issues
- Added warnings instead of failures for individual file addition problems

### 4. No Adaptive Batch Processing
**Problem**: System used fixed batch sizes regardless of available resources.

**Solution**:
- Implemented adaptive batch sizing (reduces from 100 to 25 files when errors occur)
- Added real-time disk space checking during backup process
- Automatic batch size reduction when space is low

### 5. Insufficient Error Recovery
**Problem**: System would fail completely on any ZIP-related error.

**Solution**:
- Added retry mechanisms with smaller batch sizes
- Continue backup even if individual files fail to add
- Better error reporting with specific guidance for users

## Testing Recommendations

1. Test on hosting with unlimited space (like Altervista)
2. Test with very large sites (GB+ in size)
3. Test scheduled backups
4. Test with artificially low disk space
5. Test backup resumption after errors
